Hello,

We have noticed you are hosting a GitHub repository that contains (possible) solutions for assignments that are part of the “Shape Modeling and Geometry Processing” course taught at ETH Zurich. Designing these exercises required a lot of time and effort. In order to provide our students with high quality homework and a fair grading, we kindly ask you to make this repository private or alternatively remove any references that make this repository identifiably belong to the Shape Modeling course (including in sub-directories). This includes (but is not limited to) the following terms: 
* Shape Modeling and Geometry Processing
* smgp
* gp19, gp20, gp21

Kind regards,
The 2022 TAs
